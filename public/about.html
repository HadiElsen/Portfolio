<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Web Developer in the making. Although my background is in business, I fell in love with Tech after I finished my studies (Ironic innit) and want to bring the heat to the web development scene</p>
<p>I bring the best of both worlds, for my experience in business and my tech-savviness drive me to be not only a great web developer, but a developer that adapts to all of your need.</p>
<p>What can I say, I'm a jack of all trades.</p>
